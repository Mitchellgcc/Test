🧠 THE FULLY UPDATED AUTONOMOUS CURSOR MICRO-WORKFLOW

🔧 STEP 1: PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP

✅ 1.1 Create the environment.json
Tell Cursor how to install, start, and test your project inside the agent VM:

⚠️ CRITICAL: Use non-interactive commands to prevent agents from getting stuck on prompts!

{
  "install": "rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install && pnpm build",
  "terminals": [
    { "name": "dev", "command": "pnpm dev" },
    { "name": "test", "command": "pnpm test" },
    { "name": "build", "command": "pnpm build" },
    { "name": "lint", "command": "pnpm lint" }
  ]
}
install → run once on VM start (removes node_modules first to avoid interactive prompts)
terminals → background watchers visible in Cursor interface
📁 Save this to: .cursor/environment.json

✅ 1.2 Define your Cursor Rules
These act as architectural and behavioral constraints injected into every agent session:

- Use TypeScript for all backend and frontend logic
- Avoid editing any files in /legacy or /vendor
- Always generate unit and integration tests with new features
- Use async/await only, never .then()
- Follow domain-driven naming conventions (e.g., loginController)
- Keep directory well structured & well organised, build folders where necessary
- Always add parseable terminal output to test runners:
  - console.log("✅ TESTS PASSED") for success
  - console.log("❌ TEST FAILURE") for failures
- Run tests via pnpm test and show clear ✅ or ❌ status
- Add extra logging during testing for maximum visibility
- When tests fail, keep adding logging until issues are identified and fixed
- Always check if a server/dev process is running before starting a new one
- Use chat.completions.create for OpenAI API calls, not deprecated endpoints
- For web projects: use dark mode, colorful DaisyUI, Tailwind, and anime.js
- Include nice waiting animations for user-facing operations
- Always run tests live unless specifically asked to mock
📁 Save this to: .cursor/rules

✅ 1.3 Initialize Git Repository (REQUIRED)
Background agents need Git to create branches and submit PRs:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git branch -m main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup: Autonomous Cursor workflow infrastructure"
git push -u origin main

🚨 WITHOUT GIT SETUP, AGENTS CANNOT CREATE BRANCHES OR SUBMIT PRS!

✅ 1.4 Create .gitignore
Add comprehensive .gitignore to prevent committing unnecessary files:

# Dependencies
node_modules/
# Production builds
dist/
build/
out/
# Environment variables
.env*
# OS files
.DS_Store
# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
# And more...

✅ 1.5 Persist domain knowledge in Memories
Store key domain concepts once—they're retrieved automatically in future prompts:

"We use JWT for authentication, not sessions."
"UI built with React + Tailwind."
"Tests must run via pnpm test and show ✅ or ❌."
🧠 Add memories manually via the right-side panel > Memories tab in Cursor.

🗂 STEP 2: PREPARE DAILY TASK PLAN (external to Cursor)

✅ 2.1 Write a task backlog (outside the repo)
Create a tasks.md or dayplan.txt on your desktop like:

## Feature: Analytics Dashboard

Agent: analytics-ui-agent  
1. Create /analytics React page  
2. Add props for chart injection  
3. Render placeholder bar chart  
4. Build 3 test cases: render, empty, failure  
5. Retry chart if tests fail  
6. Submit PR

Agent: analytics-api-agent  
1. Create /api/funnels GET route  
2. Hook into analytics DB  
3. Add integration test for response  
4. Log ❌/✅ in terminal output  
5. Push PR
📝 Important: Cursor does not read this file. It's your personal queue to paste into agents or Slack messages.

🤖 STEP 3: SPAWN AND QUEUE AGENTS

✅ 3.1 Open Cursor and the project
Wait for full index and .cursor/ parsing.

✅ 3.2 Spawn each Background Agent
For each task group:

Press Ctrl + E → New Background Agent
Name it (auth-agent, analytics-ui-agent, etc.)
Cursor creates a branch for that agent: feature/auth-agent
Paste your first prompt (from your task file)

⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING: If agent gets stuck on interactive prompts:
- Check Background Agent panel logs
- Look for prompts like "Proceed? (Y/n)"
- Cancel agent and respawn with fixed environment.json

✅ 3.3 Queue follow-up prompts
While the agent is running, queue steps like:

Run all tests via pnpm test  
If any test fails, retry generation with improved error handling  
If all tests pass, open a PR with summary  
Include test coverage in the PR body
📌 Prompts execute in order once the current one finishes. You can monitor via the Background Agent panel.

🧪 STEP 4: ENABLE SELF-MONITORING & SELF-HEALING

✅ 4.1 Add parseable terminal output to test runner
In your test files or scripts, add:

if (testsPassed) {
  console.log("✅ UNIT TESTS PASSED");
} else {
  console.log("❌ UNIT TEST FAILURE");
}
✅ 4.2 Structure prompts to handle failure
In your agent queue:

Run tests  
If output includes ❌, identify which tests failed and regenerate those cases  
Retry tests once  
If ✅ appears, continue to PR
💡 Cursor agents can read terminal output if it is consistent and formatted predictably.

🛰️ STEP 5: ORCHESTRATE REMOTELY (OPTIONAL)

✅ 5.1 Enable Slack Integration
Invite the @Cursor bot to a Slack channel
Format messages like:
@Cursor repo=org/repo-name

Spawn agent `login-agent`:  
1. Refactor login page using Tailwind  
2. Add form validation with Zod  
3. Retry if login.test.ts fails  
4. Submit PR
✅ 5.2 Use the Cursor Web Dashboard
View agent progress and logs live
Add prompts to existing agents
Kill, restart, or duplicate agents
Supports mobile (iOS/Android) via browser
🔗 Search for Cursor web dashboard

🔁 STEP 6: CODE REVIEW AND PR MANAGEMENT

✅ 6.1 Let BugBot handle PR review
Each agent-submitted PR is reviewed by BugBot
Comments include test status, logic flags, and best practices
Appears inline in the PR and in Cursor interface
✅ 6.2 Optional: Run manual review agent
Spawn a new Background Agent with:

1. Checkout PR #123  
2. Run tests  
3. If coverage < 90% or test fails, comment inline  
4. Approve PR if clean
Cursor does not yet support full auto-approval → merging is still manual (or via GitHub rules).

✅ 6.3 "Fix in Cursor" Button
Appears inside the Cursor IDE only when BugBot flags an issue.

Clicking it brings you to the exact diff and opens a rewrite prompt.
🧼 STEP 7: CLEAN-UP & DAILY RESET

✅ 7.1 Merge and clean branches
After approval, use GitHub's merge UI or gh pr merge
Cursor will delete the agent's branch automatically if configured
✅ 7.2 Archive daily task logs
Rename your external tasks.md to tasks-2025-07-03.md for history tracking

🚨 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

❌ Agent stuck on interactive prompts
✅ Fix: Use "rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install" in environment.json

❌ Agent can't create branches/PRs
✅ Fix: Initialize Git repository with remote origin

❌ Tests don't show ✅/❌ status
✅ Fix: Add console.log statements with exact format

❌ Agent ignores architectural rules
✅ Fix: Add specific constraints to .cursor/rules
